NAME
    Dancer::Plugin::EmptyGIF - Quick empty GIF response

SYNOPSIS
     use Dancer;
     use Dancer::Plugin::EmptyGIF;
 
     get '/tracking/pixel.gif' => sub {
       # do something with params
       return empty_gif;
     }

METHODS
  empty_gif
    This will set your set your current request response to be an empty gif,
    this means, it will return binary data for the image and set the
    appropriate headers. You should always "return empty_gif".

WHY
    An empty gif response is specially useful when you're building a
    webservice that processes all the URL and/or query string parameters and
    at the end, an empty gif needs to be returned to the client. This a
    tracking or reporting pixel. Once the request has reached your
    application code, it's better not to do any more redirections and
    quickly return the empty pixel from within your code.
